# K-means Clustering - Obesity Dataset

This project implements the **K-means** algorithm to perform **clustering** on an obesity-related dataset, using demographic and lifestyle factors.  
The quality of the clusters is evaluated with the **Silhouette Score**, and visualizations are generated to interpret the results.
